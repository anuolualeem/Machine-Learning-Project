# Predicting the Presence of Heart Disease in Patients with Machine Learning
## Objectives
Our Objectives for this project are:
* To predict patients suffering from heart disease using seven different machine learning classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and AdaBoost classifier
* And to estimate and compare the performance of all the classifiers, in order to select the one with the best performance.
## Datasource
The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset found in [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) was used for this project
